This dataset contains sensor data that was collected in the home of
a volunteer adult.  The resident in the home was a woman.  The woman's
children and grandchildren visited on a regular basis.

The following activities are annotated within the dataset. 
The number in parentheses is the number of times the activity appears in the data.
- Relax (2910)
- Meal_Preparation (1606)
- Enter_Home (431)
- Leave_Home (431)
- Sleeping (401)
- Eating (257)
- Work (171)
- Bed_to_Toilet (157)
- Wash_Dishes (65)
- Housekeeping (33)

- Resperate (6)
  RESPeRATE device, which is a FDA-cleared medical device designed to help lower blood pressure through guided breathing exercises.

The sensor events are generated from 
  motion sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "M"), 
  door closure sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "D"), and
  temperature sensors (these sensor IDs begin with "T").

The layout of the sensors in the home is shown in the file aruba.jpg.
